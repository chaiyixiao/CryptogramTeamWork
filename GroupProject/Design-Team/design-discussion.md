# Individual Designs

## Design 1 (xliang70)

There are several good aspects in this design.

The UML diagram is very simple and concise capturing the requirements in detail. It shows the relationships between the entities as specified by the requirements in a detailed manner. Every attribute that has been mentioned in the requirement has been added at the appropriate entity, so that the solution can be implemented without any gaps.

Here are some of the improvements that can be made:

Classes can be created in a hierarchical manner if it can be abstracted out into a common class. Distinct classes can be used for User, player and administrator. A cryptogram can be solved by all players, and this data needs to be captured for every player. Association classes has to be used to capture this data. 

Even though, there are minor enhancements that can be made, this is a very good design.
