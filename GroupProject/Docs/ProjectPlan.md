# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 19
**Version**: V1.0

## 1 Introduction

We are developing a cryptogram puzzles game on the Android OS, with which kids can practice solving cryptograms and compare their progress. The client of this project can add new cryptograms to the game.

## 2 Process Description

Following the unified process, we have four phases and several activities. Activities are iterative and incremental and therefore spread through all the phases. For simplicity, each activity (shown in bold) is listed in the phase where itâ€™s involved most.

### I. Inception

- **Business Modeling**: to analyze major users and tentative achitectures of the system; to set up a basic project plan; and to estimate schedule and cost

	- _Entrance criteria_: project started
	- _Exit criteria_: team-wide agreement on scope, definition and shcedule estimations; faithful and credible understanding on requirements, feautures, constraints, and development process; and the following deliverables:
        - vision documents
        - initial use case model
        - initial business case
        - initial project plan


### II. Elaboration

- **Requirements Analysis**: to analyze the system requirements in detail, and to show the analysis results with a complete use case model

	- _Entrance criteria_: project started, and partial business model finished; team-wide agreement
	- _Exit criteria_: complete clear, thorough understanding of the system requirements; team-wide agreement on the use case model; and the following deliverables
		- almost complete use case model
		- supplementary requirements

- **Solution Analysis & Design**: to establish a candidate software achitecture, which includes: to design components, functions, and their connections; to analysis how components are deployed on devices; and to design the static class structure

	- _Entrance criteria_: partial business modeling and partial requirements analysis finished; team-wide agreement
	- _Exit criteria_: stable and validated vision and achitecture; major risks addressed/resovled; a detailed/accurate construction plan; team-wide agreement on the plan; and the following deliverables:
		- design/achitecture document
		- component diagram
		- deployment diagram
		- class diagram
		- UI mockups
		- construction plan
		- test plan


### III. Construction

- **Implementation**: to write code to realize the components and features of the system; to integrate various components altogether to make the whole system work as expected. The process may be divided into several iterations for completing various components and features.

	- _Entrance criteria_: most part of the solution analysis and design are finished with no questions, team-wide agreement
	- _Exit criteria_: realized use cases with traceable information, executable and tested code ready for deployment; team-wide agreement on deployment; and the following deliverables
		- complete application
		- user manual
		- test cases and test manual
		- revisions on previous deliverables

- **Test**: to develop complete and thorough test cases to verify and validate features based on the requirements, and use cases

	- _Entrance criteria_: once some bulk code for a component is finished, or some integration of components is finished
	- _Exit criteria_: thorogh test cases created and passed for all the components and features; and the following deliverables
		- test cases and test manual
		- revision on previous deliverables


### IV. Transition

- **Deployment**: to transit the software from development to into real production; to create support materials for users; to carry out end-user test and collect feedback; to plan revisied releases based on issues and feedback received

	- _Entrance criteria_: an alpha verison of executable and tested application released, team-wide agreement
    - _Exite criteria_: issued resolved, complete in-use project, user satisfied, cost acceptable, and the following deliverables
    	- final stable realse of the project
    	- revised user manual
    	- issues and user feedback
    	- reviion on previous deliverables
