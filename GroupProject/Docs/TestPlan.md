# Test Plan


**Author**: Team 19

This test plan is created for the Cryptogram application developed for Boston Towers. The primary goal of the application is to keep the kids busy by solving cryptograms and comparing their progress. 

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy


We need to design, develop, test and deliver this project in a short time frame. Since we are a gang of four, we have limited resources. Given this, we would like to automate most of the test cases, so that we have a good coverage.
 
Unit Tests - Every individual developers will run an Unit test on their module to ensure that it is fully functional in all respects. Every defect that is identified and fixed in this stage will help us save a of wasted efforts in the future. Creating a cryptogram and verifying, if the cryptogram is working as desired on a handheld device is a very time consuming process. We will create a set of test cases that will be automated to ensure that the cryptogram functionality is good. The developer responsible for cryptogram verification will carry out the task.  

Integration Tests - Once every parts of the application is unit tested, every one will work together on the integration tests. These tests will ensure that all the modules are able to work with each other and successfully deliver the functionality.  

System - We will designate one person as the Test lead. This person will run the functional tests to  ensure that the product meets all the necessary requirements.

Regression - After the code is complete, during the testing phase, defects may be found. Whenever these defects are fixed, it is possible that the related areas were affected. To ensure that the fix did not introduce any new defects, we need to test the areas related to the fix. This will be typically carried out by the same individual who reported the trouble. He will use the input from the person who fixed it, to gain an understanding of the fix to narrow down the areas to test.

### 1.2 Test Selection


The test selection for this project will be done using the category partition method.

This technique follows 6 simple steps;
1. Identify independent testable features
2. Identify categories among the features
3. Partition the categories
4. Identify constraints
5. Produce/evaluate test case specification
6. Generate test cases from the above  specification


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion


We will use a combination of both Black-box and White-box to ensure all aspects of functionality is covered. If we start enumerating the tests without a proven process, it is always possible to miss a scenario. So, we will follow the category-partition technique to create our test cases. 

Running the Regression tests along with System tests will ensure that we have adequate coverage of all possible scenarios.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking


There are several tools to track bugs like Bugzilla, JIRA, Mantis, etc.. After discussions, we decided to use GitHub. By using GitHub, we can track the bugs and related code changes in one place. 

### 1.5 Technology


We will use the available technologies to the fullest extent to ensure efficient testing of the applications. We will use JUnit to run all the Unit test cases. Some of the integration test will also be created and run using JUnit.
